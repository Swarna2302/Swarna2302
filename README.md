### 🔍 My Top Projects

🎵 **Spotify Song Popularity Prediction**  
  Built a machine learning model to classify Spotify tracks as "popular" or "non-popular" using audio features like tempo, energy, and danceability. Evaluated multiple ML algorithms including KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Polynomial Regression.  
  **Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib  
  **Highlights:** Data sourced from Kaggle & UCI | Exploratory Data Analysis + Model Comparison

🏦 **Smart ATM Interface System**  
  Developed a Java-based console application that simulates real-time ATM operations — including deposits, withdrawals with limit checks, account creation, balance inquiry, and transaction logs.  
  **Tech Stack:** Java, OOP, File Handling  
  **Highlights:** Realistic banking flow | Robust input validation | Transaction history tracking

🔗 **Counterfeit Product Detection using Blockchain & QR Codes**  
  Designed a Java-based system that uses blockchain-backed QR codes to verify product authenticity. Included QR generation, secure product database, and an intuitive NetBeans-based user interface.  
  **Tech Stack:** Java, DBMS, Blockchain, QR Code API, NetBeans  
  **Highlights:** Anti-counterfeit system | Secure QR verification | Real-world supply chain use case
